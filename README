DESCRIPTION

# maps are ordered.  constructing them in an ordered fashion builds them that
# way
#
  m = Map[:k, :v, :key, :val]
  m = Map(:k, :v, :key, :val)

  m = Map[[:k, :v], [:key, :val]]
  m = Map[{:k => :v, :key => :val}]


  m = Map.new
  m[:a] = 0
  m[:b] = 1
  m[:c] = 2

  p m.keys #=> ['a','b','c']  ### always ordered!
  p m.keys #=> [0,1,2]        ### always ordered!

# maps don't care between symbol and string keys
#
  p m[:a]  #=> 0
  p m["a"] #=> 0

# many functions operate in a way one would expect from an ordered container
#
  m.update(:k2 => :v2)
  m.update(:k2, :v2)

# maps keep mapiness for even deep operations
#
  m.update :nested => {:hashes => {:are => :converted}}

# maps can give back clever little struct objects
#
  m = Map(:foo => {:bar => 42})
  s = m.struct
  p s.foo.bar #=> 42
